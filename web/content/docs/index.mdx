## Install the thing

```bash
npm install @vcui/popser
```

Base UI is a peer dependency. You need it. Don't argue.

```bash
npm install @base-ui/react
```

### Already using shadcn?

One command. Themes, CSS variables, the lot. Skip the rest of this page, honestly.

```bash
npx shadcn add @vcode-sh/popser
```

More on the [shadcn page](/docs/shadcn) if you're curious. You probably aren't.

## Wire it up

Stick `<Toaster>` somewhere in your app. It portals to `document.body` because it doesn't trust your layout skills.

```tsx
import { Toaster } from "@vcui/popser";
import "@vcui/popser/styles";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <YourApp />
      <Toaster />
    </>
  );
}
```

No Provider. No context wrapper. No five-layer-deep component tree. Just one component.

## Pop a toast

Import `toast`. Call it. Event handlers, server actions, `useEffect`, the toilet — wherever. No hooks. No ceremony.

```ts
import { toast } from "@vcui/popser";

toast("Hello world");
toast.success("Saved");
toast.error("Something broke");
toast.info("Heads up");
toast.warning("Careful");
```

Every method spits back the toast ID. Keep it if you want to update or close things later.

```ts
const id = toast.loading("Uploading...");

// ...whenever your API stops napping
toast.update(id, {
  title: "Upload complete",
  type: "success",
  timeout: 3000,
});
```

## Now what

You've got toasts. Congrats. Here's where it gets interesting:

- [Toast API](/docs/api) — every method, every option, the full arsenal
- [Toaster](/docs/toaster) — position, theme, limits, all the knobs
- [Styling](/docs/styling) — CSS variables, classNames, Tailwind, the works
- [Anchored Toasts](/docs/anchored) — pin to elements, clicks, coordinates. The thing Sonner still hasn't shipped.
- [Promise Toasts](/docs/promise) — loading → success → error, automatically
